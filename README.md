# Functional RoadBot

## Introduction
Raising awareness for road safety is one thing and facilitating it is another. India still ranks first in terms of number of road accident deaths across 199 countries and accounts for almost 11% of all accident-related deaths in the world [1]. While roaring and successful movements are well underway for re-designing roads and streets that are people-centric and not automobile-centric in major Indian cities, facilitating timely improvements for existing road networks is a pressing need, given continuing fatalities caused due to poor construction practices, minimal adherence to IRC norms, and reckless driving among a myriad of other concerns which make roads in Indian cities dangerous.

Reducing road accidents, congestion, travel time delay and fuel consumption are front and centre to the larger agendas of improving urban livability in India, and therefore, we are pleased to propose the theme of Functional RoadBot in eYRC 2022-23. The RoadBot works constantly to assess the road and tries to work on the construction zone as swiftly as possible. The RoadBot is controlled using Raspberry Pi and programmed in Elixir. Elixir is a Functional Programming language that helps in efficient utilisation of multiple cores in Raspberry Pi.

The arena abstracts a road area that contains potholes that must be filled with construction material. The RoadBot will search for road segments in need of maintenance and will provide service by filling potholes with a dispensing mechanism. When a road is being serviced, it will be closed for a set amount of time. The RoadBot will operate in accordance with the traffic on a specific road segment.

Teams will learn Functional Programming Language: Elixir, Image Processing, Algorithm Development. The team that fills the maximum number of potholes in the shortest amount of time with minimum penalties wins.


## Objective
With the help of this theme we can work on the startup for the RoadBot which will solve the IRC (India Road Congress) problem, i.e. to pour the dump or pot holes of Indian roads on minimum time with proper maintenance of traffic signal.
This will reduce the hazardous road accident which are occurred due to potholes located in main road area.
